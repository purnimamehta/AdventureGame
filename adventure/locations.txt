You are on the second floor of the UTM Library. It's usually crowded at this time of the day, but today it's eerily quiet.
Only a few students are studying inside one of the study rooms. You better not disturb them. A librarian stands near the
service desk, looking bored and sleepy. There is a washroom to the South and stairs leading to the third floor to the East.

You are on the third floor. There is a study room to the South.
You are on the third floor and its a complete mess. Looks like someone threw a surprise birthday party and left everything there for the janitors to clean up.
Maybe your cheat sheet is on the floor somewhere? But no one is around to help you clean it, what will you do?

This study room is completely empty.
You are in an empty study room. And by empty, we mean, absolutely empty. All the tables and chairs have been taken out,
the whiteboards taken off the wall, not even the carpeting is left. Are they planning to do something else with this space?
