You are on the first floor of the UTM Library. It's usually crowded at this time of the day, but today it's eerily quiet.
Only a few students are studying inside one of the study rooms. You better not disturb them. A librarian stands near the
service desk, looking bored and sleepy. There is an empty study room to the South, an exit from the library to the North.

You are in an empty study room. And by empty, we mean, absolutely empty. All the tables and chairs have been taken out,
